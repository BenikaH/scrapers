# Scrapers
If I ever create scrapers for any data project, I plan to make those __half-baked__ scrapers available here.

##Contents

Name | The hell is it meant for? |
--- | --- |
elance_scraper | scrapes the data (name, tagline, rate, rating, skills, category, level and number of jobs) of [freelancers listed on Elance by country](https://www.elance.com/r/contractors/cry-NP/fbk-0/p-1). | 
canteen_scraper | scrapes the feedback form of my college's canteen's food ordering system. |


Note: I am a beginner in python.
